  // it points at an object that is later chosen for the collection set). There are
  // also cases where the referent of a weak reference ends up in the SATB
  // and is later collected. In these cases the oop in the SATB buffer becomes
  // invalid and the _next_ cycle will crash during its marking phase. To
  // avoid this problem, we "purge" the SATB buffers during the final update
  // references phase if (and only if) an old generation mark is in progress.
  // At this stage we can safely determine if any of the oops in the SATB
  // buffer belong to trashed regions (before they are recycled). As it

  // been marked - which is the case for anything that is being evacuated
