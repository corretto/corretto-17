  // The logic for cset selection in adaptive is as follows:
  //
  //   1. We cannot get cset larger than available free space. Otherwise we guarantee OOME
  //      during evacuation, and thus guarantee full GC. In practice, we also want to let
  //      application to allocate something. This is why we limit CSet to some fraction of
  //      available space. In non-overloaded heap, max_cset would contain all plausible candidates
  //      over garbage threshold.
  //
  //   2. We should not get cset too low so that free threshold would not be met right
  //      after the cycle. Otherwise we get back-to-back cycles for no reason if heap is
  //      too fragmented. In non-overloaded non-fragmented heap min_garbage would be around zero.
  //
  // Therefore, we start by sorting the regions by garbage. Then we unconditionally add the best candidates
  // before we meet min_garbage. Then we add all candidates that fit with a garbage threshold before
  // we hit max_cset. When max_cset is hit, we terminate the cset selection. Note that in this scheme,
  // ShenandoahGarbageThreshold is the soft threshold which would be ignored until min_garbage is hit.

  // In generational mode, the sort order within the data array is not strictly descending amounts of garbage.  In
  // particular, regions that have reached tenure age will be sorted into this array before younger regions that contain
  // more garbage.  This represents one of the reasons why we keep looking at regions even after we decide, for example,
  // to exclude one of the regions because it might require evacuation of too much live data.
